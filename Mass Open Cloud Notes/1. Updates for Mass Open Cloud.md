# Mass Open Cloud Updates

## 1. I followed steps on the OpenStack tutorial for Mass Open Cloud.
#### [Check here for the tutorials](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-public/wiki/OpenStack-Tutorial-Index)

  a. Set up Private Network

  b. Create a Router

  c. Security Groups

  d. Create a Key Pair

  e. Launch a VM

  f. Assign a Floating IP

  g. SSH into your VM

 ## 2. Steps for Installing OpenShift CLI
  
  a. get a Red Hat free Customer Portal Account

  b. [Download OpenShift CLI here](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/ver=4.3/rhel---8/4.3.3/x86_64/product-software)

  c. Log into OpenShift CLI using your [OpenShift login info](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html)

 - Steps to set up secrets
 
      1. Create secret

      2. oc new-app openshift/pman-openshift-template.json
        
          ```bash
            oc new-app openshift/pman-openshift-template.json
            
            oc create secret generic kubecfg --from-file=$HOME/.kube/config -n myproject
            
            oc create -f example-secret.yml 
            
          ```

      $HOME/.kube/config file: 

                  [AUTHORIZATION]
                  osAuthUrl = https://kaizen.massopen.cloud:13000/v3
                  username  = <your username>
                  password  = <your password>

                  [PROJECT]
                  osProjectDomain = default
                  osProjectName   = <project_name>
          or: 

                  [AUTHORIZATION]
                  osAuthUrl = https://kaizen.massopen.cloud:13000/v3
                  username  = <your username>
                  password  = <your password>

                  [PROJECT]
                  osProjectDomain = default
                  osProjectName   = <project_name>
                  vi ~/.swift/swift-credentials.cfg 

      Other options for creating secrets with Swift: 

               oc create secret generic swift-credentials --from-file=<path-to-file>/swift-credentials.cfg

 ## 4. Received instructions from Robert, the MOC System Admin on how to get tokens with OpenShift
 
 Notes:
 - Log into power9 clusters with this link: https://p9-openshift.osh.massopen.cloud:8443 

 So try the following:

1. Copy the login from the GUI after you have logged in.  It is the drop down that has your username in the upper right hand corer of the web page.  It should have the form of:

        oc login https://k-openshift.osh.massopen.cloud:8443 --token=asdfFFxasdfpoqwlnsadfgo-adsasd14

  This should give the responsibility like:
          
      You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

        * benchmarking-chris-on-the-moc
          rbb-001

      Using project "benchmarking-chris-on-the-moc".

2. Now you should be able to get a response back from oc as in oc get all:
    
    ```bash
        oc get all
            
     ```

3. I am not sure if you actually typed tried, "oc create secret generic kubecfg --from-file=$HOME/.kube/config -n myproject" - if so replace myproject with benchmarking-chris-on-the-moc, as you have admin privileges on the benchmarking-chris-on-the-moc project.  As in:

        oc -n benchmarking-chris-on-the-moc create secret generic kubecfg --from-file=.kube/config 
              secret/kubecfg created

In my case $Home is not in my environment, and I really don't feel like adding it.  You need to ensure $HOME is in your environment and is actually set to the correct value, and that $HOME/.kube/config exists.

Keep in mind that the token that your .kube/config is only good for I think 4 hours.  So redo the process when you can no longer log in.
