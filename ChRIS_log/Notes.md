# Terminologies: Container, Docker and other

- What is a Container?

  A container is a standard unit of software that packages up ***code*** and all its ***dependencies*** so the application runs quickly and reliably
from one environment to another.
  
- What is Docker Container Image?

  Docker container image is a package from runnable software to all things needed to run it, including code, runtime, system tools, system
  libraries and settings.
  
- What's good about this design pattern?
  
  Containerized application always runs the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure it
  works uniformly.
